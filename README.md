## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this a standalone plugin or does it go along with a theme?

Well, I'm glad you asked that rather specific question. This plugin was designed in concert with the [UCLA Branded Accessible WordPress Theme](https://bitbucket.org/uclaucomm/ucla-sc), and, although it works/fits best when used with that theme, the plugin should work independently as well.
